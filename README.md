## Description
-  A simple Python tool that helps you identify which users you follow on Instagram do not follow you back. By analyzing the JSON data provided by Instagramâ€™s data export tool, the script compares your list of followers and followings to generate a list of non-followers. This tool provides a simple and reliable way to manage your Instagram connections without relying on third-party apps or services that may steal your data.
